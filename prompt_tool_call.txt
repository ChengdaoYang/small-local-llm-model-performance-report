Prompt: Tool-Use Test for MCP / Function-Calling

Scenario:

You are an AI assistant with access to the following tools. Each tool has a specific purpose and required arguments. Your goal is to achieve the user request by calling the tools correctly in sequence.

Available Tools:

weather_check(city: str, date: str) -> str

Returns the weather forecast for a given city and date.

currency_convert(amount: float, from_currency: str, to_currency: str) -> float

Converts an amount from one currency to another.

stock_price(symbol: str, date: str) -> float

Returns the closing price of a stock on a given date.

book_flight(origin: str, destination: str, date: str, class: str) -> str

Books a flight and returns a booking reference.

send_email(recipient: str, subject: str, body: str) -> bool

Sends an email and returns True if successful.

User Request (Test Challenge):

Check the weather in Tokyo next Friday.

If the temperature is below 15°C, convert $200 USD to JPY.

Check the stock price of AAPL last Monday.

Book a business-class flight from New York to Tokyo next Friday.

Send an email to your manager summarizing:

Tokyo weather

USD to JPY conversion (if applicable)

AAPL stock price

Flight booking reference

Requirements for Model Response:

Use only the tools provided. Do not invent extra functions.

Decide conditional logic based on tool outputs.

Format the response as tool calls in order, then provide a final summary.

Do not output fake results unless explicitly instructed — simulate tool calls.

Extra Challenge for the Model:

Some tools’ outputs are needed as inputs for other tools (e.g., currency_convert depends on weather condition).

The model should reason about which tools to call first.

The prompt tests: tool selection, argument filling, conditional execution, and summarizing results.
